Design and simulate a time-measurement circuit. The circuit will be composed of two
main components:
1. 
A time unit (e.g. ms, s) measurement component. This block will count an integer
number of clock periods, based on the clock frequence (e.g. for 50 MHz clock signal, a
second will consist of 50 millions clock periods).
2. 
A component that will count the number of time units passed since 0.

The assignment will consist of:
1. 
Provide the scheme for this type of circuit (handwritten on paper).
2. 
Simulate your design for a clock frequency of 2.5 MHz and a time unit of 1 ms
